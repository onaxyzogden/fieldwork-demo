# Fieldwork — Interactive Handyman Platform Prototype

[Open the demo](https://onaxyzogden.github.io/fieldwork-demo/)

A responsive prototype for evaluating customer intake, operator scheduling and dispatch, and contractor job offers. All sample names, properties, prices, and transactions are fictional. This is a demonstration, not a live booking or payment service.

## Try the demo

Open the link on a computer, tablet, or smartphone. Use the role switcher and five scenario shortcuts:

1. **Door adjustment:** Customer → describe/clarify/confirm → address → approved appointment → simulated payment → confirmed visit.
2. **Four-task visit:** Operator → Do It Myself → create a bundled visit → send quote. Customer approves and pays in the simulation.
3. **Delegate a job:** Operator selects a contractor and sends an offer. Contractor accepts. Customer approves the quote and pays before confirmation.
4. **Needs review:** Restricted work requires operator review and an eligible specialist; ordinary Instant Book is blocked.
5. **Decline & reassign:** Contractor declines the TV mounting offer. The operator sees an actionable alert and can choose another contractor or Do It Myself.

Optional automatic reoffers are in Operator → Demo settings. They retain the appointment and pay, notify the operator, and require an eligible contractor. No suitable replacement leaves the operator an action-required alert.

The sun/moon button switches themes. Demo settings can reset sample data or advance the simulated clock. Requests, offers, payments, settings, and notifications are saved in each browser independently. They do not synchronize between devices. Visitors never receive another visitor's locally entered information.

## Run locally

Use Node.js 22 and npm:

```sh
npm ci
npm run dev
```

Open the URL printed by Vite with `/fieldwork-demo/` as the path. Run `npm test` for the business-rule tests and `npm run build` to generate the static site in `dist/`.

## Deployment

Push changes to `main`. GitHub Actions installs dependencies, runs tests, builds the site, and publishes to GitHub Pages. The workflow can also be started manually from Actions. Pages must use **GitHub Actions** as its build source.

`vite.config.ts` sets the base path to `/fieldwork-demo/`. If the repository is renamed, update that value and the demo link.

## Prototype boundaries

- Service Request → Tasks → Visit → Assignment are separate records; quotes and payments have independent state.
- Rule-based classification and deterministic scheduling; no external AI, geocoding, or traffic service.
- CAD prices and America/Toronto appointment times; sample dates are relative to initial load.
- Payments and notifications are simulated. No real charges, messages, authentication, or credential verification.
- Role switching demonstrates workflows; it is not a security boundary.
- Optional photos stay in browser storage. Only use non-sensitive test data.
- No offline installation or service worker. An internet connection is required to load the app.
- Light/dark themes and responsive layouts support phones, tablets, and desktops.
