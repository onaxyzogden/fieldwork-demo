# Fieldwork — Interactive Handyman Platform Prototype

[Open the demo](https://onaxyzogden.github.io/fieldwork-demo/)

A responsive prototype for evaluating customer intake, operator scheduling and dispatch, and contractor job offers. All sample names, properties, prices, and transactions are fictional. This is a demonstration, not a live booking or payment service.

## Try the demo

Open the link on a computer, tablet, or smartphone. Use the role switcher and five scenario shortcuts:

1. **Door adjustment:** Customer → describe/clarify/confirm → address → approved appointment → simulated payment → confirmed visit.
2. **Four-task visit:** Operator → Do It Myself → create a bundled visit → send quote. Customer approves and pays in the simulation.
3. **Delegate a job:** Operator selects a contractor and sends an offer. Contractor accepts. Customer approves the quote and pays before confirmation.
4. **Needs review:** Restricted work requires operator review and an eligible specialist; ordinary Instant Book is blocked.
5. **Decline & reassign:** Contractor declines the TV mounting offer. The operator sees an actionable alert and can choose another contractor or Do It Myself.

Optional automatic reoffers are in Operator → Demo settings. They retain the appointment and pay, notify the operator, and require an eligible contractor. No suitable replacement leaves the operator an action-required alert.

The sun/moon button switches themes. Demo settings can reset sample data or advance the simulated clock. Requests, offers, payments, settings, and notifications are saved in each browser independently. They do not synchronize between devices. Visitors never receive another visitor's locally entered information.

## Run locally

Use Node.js 22 and npm:

```sh
npm ci
npm run dev
```

Open the URL printed by Vite with `/fieldwork-demo/` as the path. Run `npm test` for the business-rule tests and `npm run build` to generate the static site in `dist/`.

## Deployment

Push changes to `main`. GitHub Actions installs dependencies, runs tests, builds the site, and publishes to GitHub Pages. The workflow can also be started manually from Actions. Pages must use **GitHub Actions** as its build source.

`vite.config.ts` sets the base path to `/fieldwork-demo/`. If the repository is renamed, update that value and the demo link.

## Prototype boundaries

- Service Request → Tasks → Visit → Assignment are separate records; quotes and payments have independent state.
- Rule-based classification and deterministic scheduling; no external AI, geocoding, or traffic service.
- CAD prices and America/Toronto appointment times; sample dates are relative to initial load.
- Payments and notifications are simulated. No real charges, messages, authentication, or credential verification.
- Role switching demonstrates workflows; it is not a security boundary.
- Optional photos stay in browser storage. Only use non-sensitive test data.
- No offline installation or service worker. An internet connection is required to load the app.
- Light/dark themes and responsive layouts support phones, tablets, and desktops.

## Source guide

- `src/main.tsx`: role workspaces and UI interactions.
- `src/model.ts`: classification, scheduling, eligibility, and lifecycle state.
- `src/dispatch.ts`: decline handling, replacement offers, and operator notifications.
- `src/style.css`, `src/light.css`: responsive layouts and themes.
- `src/*.test.ts`: regression tests.

## Typography verification

Shared rem sizing is defined in `src/typography.css`: body/form values 16px, introductory text 18px, headings 32–40/28–30/24px, labels 14px, compact captions 12px. Body line height is 1.6; headings and labels use 1.5. Layouts wrap and stack around larger text without page-wide overflow clipping.

Checked all three roles in both themes at 320, 390, 461, 768, and 1280px, including intake steps, request detail, routes, contractor offers/assignments, and a completed simulated booking. Checkout was checked at those widths and 640px. No horizontal page overflow was found in these checks. All 26 regression tests and the production build pass.

Browser zoom remains unrestricted. A 640px viewport checks the reflow width equivalent to 200% zoom on a 1280px window; actual browser-chrome 200% zoom was unavailable in the automated browser and remains a manual verification item.

## Issue-specific clarification

The intake library now covers 25 handyman and specialist issue types. See [the question table](CLARIFICATION-CATALOGUE.md). Customers get relevant choices, editable explicit details, optional photos, and conditional drain-product follow-ups. Answers remain attached to individual tasks and appear in customer, operator, and contractor details. Specialist intake stays on Request to Book and requires review. Existing saved answers remain compatible; no reset is needed.

Validation: 67 tests pass, including all 25 issue matches, drainage/leak distinctions, ambiguous and negative phrases, saved legacy answers, specialist booking restrictions, and door scope limits. The clogged-sink request was exercised through submission and refresh into operator Needs Review. Clarification controls fit 320, 390, 461, 768, and 1280px in both themes.

## Expanded editable catalogue

The matrix is now merged into 81 canonical issues and 268 questions. See [the full table](CLARIFICATION-CATALOGUE.md) and [editing instructions](catalogue/README.md). The two CSV files are the source of truth; generated data is checked before tests and deployment. Source row numbers preserve traceability across all 78 imported rows. No supplied licensing flag is treated as a verified qualification.

Validation includes 163 application tests and eight CSV/compiler tests. Representative checks cover specific-vs-generic matches, every canonical example, negative phrases, source coverage, saved answers, and referral-only assignment rejection. Referral intake explicitly states that the service is not bookable through the platform.
